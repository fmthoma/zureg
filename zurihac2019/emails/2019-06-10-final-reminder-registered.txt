Hello {{info.name}},

ZuriHac is only a few days away!  This email is a final reminder and contains
some more practical information.

# Registration

You have not yet confirmed your registration.  In order to get a good idea of
how many people are attending, we are asking EVERYONE to either CONFIRM their
registration, or CANCEL in case you cannot make it.  You can do both at the
following link:

    https://zureg.zfoh.ch/ticket?uuid={{uuid}}

Confirming your registration will give you access to your ticket, and canceling
will free up space for the people on the waiting list -- thank you in advance!

Once you have your ticket, please take a screenshot of the QR code so you can
show it at the registration desk -- that will get you your name badge and
T-Shirt.

# Slack team

We will use the ZuriHac Slack for on-event coordination. You can join us here:

# ZuriHac pre-party on Thursday

For those staying in Zurich, we invite you to join our yearly pre-party near the
lake.  This will take place Thursday the 13th at 19:00.  We will just socialize
and share some drinks in the sun if the weather permits it.  There are shopping
places nearby (Coop or Migros), so we will let you take care of bringing your
own drinks.

Meeting spot is the same as last year, near Zurich Bellevue / Sechseläutenplatz,
next to the lake:

You will recognize us by the Haskell T-shirts. In case the weather prediction
looks bad, we will come up with an alternative place to meet indoors. In that
case, we'll organize in the #2019-prehac-meeting channel on Slack.

Don't hesitate to come and say hi, especially if you feel like you don't know
anybody yet, we're all very friendly.

# Project organisation and room allocation

We have a lot of projects this year!  After the opening ceremony, project
maintainers will have the opportunity to give a 1 minute elevator pitch to find
collaborators.  This year, we will have a physical version of the map near the
registration desk in addition to Slack to organize coordination of project
locations.  You can still add your project here:

# Food

For lunch, we worked with HSR to provide affordable (for Swiss standards) meals,
including a vegetarian option. Lunch coupons cost CHF 12 per meal and can be
bought on Friday and Saturday (so please buy them in advance for Sunday).

On Friday evening, we will have a bring-your-own-meat-or-alternatives barbeque.
On Saturday evening, a Ramen Foodtruck will offer Japanese Noodle Soup.
